# CSGO-Text-Output-Project
What it does:
The program takes whatever output you want (for example if you get a 1k to say "bazinga" on allchat) and when you get a 1k writes whatever you want in allchat.

There are a few things you need to do before running this project.

1. Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/stable/, if you don't already have it.

2. If your CSGO is not located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo, you need to edit the .txt file in \Data\Steam Directory\ to D:\[CSGO] or wherever your csgo folder is located.

3. You need to have java installed as well from https://www.java.com/en/download/, if you don't have it already.

4. Open your console in-game and type exactly this:
bind p "exec button"

3. Click startup.bat and enjoy!

Notes:
I would not use this on ESEA, CEVO, or FaceIT. You might get banned for simulating keypresses through the windows scripthost (triggerbots do this). This is not something that will trigger VAC though, since you aren't editing any memory (or cheating).

This could be annoying to some players if you use it the whole game, so exercise discretion as always.

Questions:
>Help! It doesn't work!
You are probably running more than one instance of the program at once. If you aren't though, contact me.

>Where can I contact you about it though?
At github.com/joshuajolly or on reddit as /u/anonymous853
